# Housing-Prices-Prediction

This repository contains a simple implementation of predicting housing prices based on the area of the house using Simple Linear Regression. The implementation is done in two ways:

    Custom Implementation: A self-defined class to implement Simple Linear Regression from scratch.
    Sklearn Implementation: Using the LinearRegression model from the scikit-learn library.

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is the Housing Prices Dataset, which contains information on housing prices, including the area of each house and its corresponding price



Results

Both implementations will predict the price of a house based on the area. You can test the model with different values of Area (e.g., 3000 sq. ft.) and see the predicted price. both the case result are same
